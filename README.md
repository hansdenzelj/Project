# Project
 Background subtraction school project

## Important note
Ultralytics doesn't particularly support doing inferences using onnx(?), to make inferences using the gpu with **bs_yolov8.py**, you must replace the autobacked.py located in the **ultralytics/nn** folder of your ultralytics package installation.

## Files

bs_(method) - scripts

.onnx, .pt, .tflite - models
